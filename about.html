    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Jaspreet Kaur.</p>
    <p>I was born in India, but I have spent most of my life in Canada.
    Before coming to Canada, I lived in Spain for a year and learned some Spanish as a kid.</p>
    Right now, I am a Post-secondary student at <a href= "https://www.sait.ca/"> SAIT</a>.
    <p>More about that:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>I am a <strong>Web Design and Development</strong> at SAIT. This is my first year and I am <em>really</em> excited to finally be in a program that I am passionate about.</li>
       <li>I love combining creativity with technical skills, and web development allows me to do just that. I'm passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites that solve real-world problems.</li>
       <li>I am a <strong>lifetime learner</strong>. I believe in continuous learning, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest trends in web design and development.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, working on personal projects, and researching new design techniques. I love spending time in nature, as it helps me reconnect with my roots and feel grounded.</p>
